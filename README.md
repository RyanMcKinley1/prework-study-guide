# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- To create a well-organized and interactive website holding informational notes on from the course of the prework module. 
- To familiarize myself with the mindset, tools, and work-flow of a successful full-stacks developer. 
- Having easily accessible information to refer to in the future will help streamline problems and bugs in upcoming projects. 
- Using the building blocks given by the prework, a foundation was made for me in GitHub, git bash command line interactions, VS code, chromedev, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and developer mindsets and terminology.
